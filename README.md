# Hello folks! ðŸ‘‹

Im a frontend on [UpCities](https://upcities.app). I am currently working on projects focused on citizens and the evolution of smart cities.

I'm also creating some interesting things, like [contentcraft](https://contentcraft.pro/) and [bicos](https://bicos.me) and I'm really enjoying learning about indie hacking and that world.

ðŸ‘‰ You can get to know me better by checking out [my website](https://nicolaswalcker.com), where I write about some things that interest me.
